  paragraphOne:
    ' As a former financial analyst, i have always been good with numbers but i never felt passionate about having a long-term career in it. These past years have led to me really rethinking about my life goals and what it means to have a career doing something you love. I found out about coding from a mentor of mine who thought that it would be a good fit for me. The first day i decided to take his advise seriously was the moment i realised the beauty in creating something from scratch that you can call your own.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'Over the past year, iâ€™ve studied books, courses and practiced everything i learn into becoming a better web developer. I find it very intriguing that with just  a little effort in learning technical things, you can achieve so much. For example, i created this portfolio by just learning Gatsby and how it works. I have also been able to create websites from scratch while adopting a mobile-first workflow, which undeniably made things a lot easier for me. This can be seen in my loop-studios and sunny-side landing pages.',
  paragraphThree:
    'I am very comfortable with the usual front-end technologies like SASS, Bootstrap and javascript. Currently, i am learning react in order to build a web application that i can be proud of showing to my peers and colleagues. As time goes on, i plan on delving into other ares of software development such as backend development, as i am intrigued by the use of node on the server side. This is my portfolio and i hope it leaves a good impression on you. Thank you and have a lovely day.',
